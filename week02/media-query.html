            <h2>2 Nephi 2:11</h2>
            <p>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the
                wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery,
                neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be
                one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption,
                happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:6</h2>
            <p>And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith
                is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no
                witness until after the trial of your faith.</p>
